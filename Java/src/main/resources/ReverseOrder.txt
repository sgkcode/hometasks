FileWriter is meant for writing streams of characters. For writing streams of raw bytes, consider using a FileOutputStream.
Whether or not a file is available or may be created depends upon the underlying platform. Some platforms, in particular, allow a file to be opened for writing by only one FileWriter (or other file-writing object) at a time. In such situations the constructors in this class will fail if the file involved is already open.
Convenience class for writing character files. The constructors of this class assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer size are acceptable. To specify these values yourself, construct an OutputStreamWriter on a FileOutputStream.
extends OutputStreamWriter
public class FileWriter
